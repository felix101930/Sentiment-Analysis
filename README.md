## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task aimed at determining the sentiment or emotion conveyed in text data. This project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build and train neural network models using Keras, and evaluate their performance.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding, etc.)
- Use of neural networks for classification
- Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss)
- Visualization of training and testing results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-keras.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-keras
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the dataset
   - Train the neural network
   - Evaluate model performance

## Dataset
Tweets.csv

- Source: Deep Learning Course by Janani Ravi
- Description: Tweets Dataset with Sentinment 

## Model Architecture

The notebook implements a neural network with the following layers:

- Embedding layer
- Dense layers
- Dropout for regularization


## Results

Include a summary of the model's performance metrics, such as:

- Training and validation accuracy
- Training and validation loss
- Confusion matrix (if applicable)

Add visualizations like plots for loss and accuracy.
